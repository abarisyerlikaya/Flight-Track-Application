# Flight Track Application
 This program simulates the flights between the major capitals, such as New York, Sydney, Paris, Tokyo, Istanbul etc. around the world.

### System
 The system includes 10 routes between 5 major capitals from different continents as default. The user could also add new capitals as well as new destinations to the system. In addition to that, the user could delete and update existing destinations via the GUI. Besides, the user could declare the flight details, such as the weekdays, the departure and arrival times, the aircraft model, the flight number and the name of the airlines.

 The system has a system date, and one second in the system represents one minute in the real life. User is able to start, pause, resume and stop the time of your system. The scheduled flights is going to be simulated regarding to the system time.

 The system has a control tower to manage take offs and landings. For example, the tower manager could set some delay for a scheduled flight or she/he could cancel certain flights or even make the aircrafts, which are close to the related tower, wait in the air.

### Details

  * Add/Delete/Update capitals
